                <p class="mt-4 text-justify">Mobicare, our mobile application for hospitals, integrates seamlessly with the hospital management systems to provide patients, doctors, managerial staff, paramedics, insurance providers and all other stakeholders with superior quality user experience. It thereby helps users of the app interact with the hospital system to book or change appointments, get confirmation notifications, invoices, alerts and other updates. We developed the app after a thorough study of the needs of the healthcare industry and constant interaction with healthcare professionals, patients and management teams. The need was identified for a 24×7 contact point that is portable, handy and not restricted by the barriers of distance. It is a patient app, a hospital app and a doctor’s app rolled in one.

                <p class="mt-4 text-justify">mobiCare is designed specifically to facilitate the seamless and smooth integration of mobility features to the HIS of hospitals. A future migration to full-fledged mobility will not be a daunting task to the hospital which goes for mobiCare. We take care to distribute the load on the information system evenly through single point channels. Efficiency of the system will be boosted as information requests become more specific, eventually eliminating the transfer of irrelevant data.
